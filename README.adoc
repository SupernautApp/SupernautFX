Supernaut.FX is a lightweight dependency injection framework for JavaFX applications. It is a wrapper around the core dependency injection capability of https://micronaut.io[MicronautÂ® framework] (provided by the `micronaut-inject` JAR.) It enables the use of dependency injection in application, controller, and service objects.

CAUTION:: Supernaut.FX is a new framework. It is being used by a handful of applications in development and alpha-testing and is working well.

== Features

* JavaFX-compatible Dependency Injection
** Main application class is dependency-injected
** JavaFX FXML controllers are dependency-injected
** Service object dependency injection
* Your main "application" class need not extend `javafx.application.Application`
* `BrowserService` abstraction for opening links in Web Browser (abstraction of JavaFX `HostServices`)

== Modern

Supernaut.Fx is designed for _modern_ JavaFX applications that use the latest version of JavaFX (currently 17) and are built for distribution using either the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html[jpackage] tool of JDK 17 or as native images using GraalVM JDK 11 (using https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[native-image] and https://github.com/gluonhq/substrate[Gluon Substrate])

== Simple and Lightweight

Although Supernaut.FX does prescribe a certain structure for an application in order to enable the injection of dependencies, it aspires to be a component library for your application with the sole concern of enabling dependency injection.

Perhaps in the future it could be used as a component by other full-featured JavaFX frameworks.

== Minimal Dependencies

Supernaut.FX introduces no new dependencies beyond what is required for JavaFX and Micronaut framework:

* *JavaFX* (direct dependencies on `javafx-fxml` and `javafx-graphics`)
* *Micronaut* framework (`micronaut-inject`)
* `slf4j-api` (also used by Micronaut framework)


== Modules

Supernaut.FX currently consists of 3 modules (JARs)

|===
|Module name | Purpose | Dependencies

|https://github.com/SupernautApp/SupernautFX/blob/master/supernaut/src/main/java/module-info.java[`app.supernaut`]
| Interfaces for background components (no JavaFX)
| *No dependencies!*

|https://github.com/SupernautApp/SupernautFX/blob/master/supernaut-fx/src/main/java/module-info.java[`app.supernaut.fx`]
| JavaFX application dependency injection support
| `app.supernaut`, *JavaFX*, `slf4j-api`

|https://github.com/SupernautApp/SupernautFX/blob/master/supernaut-fx-micronaut/src/main/java/module-info.java[`app.supernaut.fx.micronaut`]
| App Launcher with dependency injection provided by Micronaut framework
| `app.supernaut.fx`, `micronaut-inject`
|===

Typical applications will have a *compile-time* dependency on `app.supernaut.fx` and a *runtime* dependency on `app.supernaut.fx.micronaut`.

You may also develop library modules for services depending only on `app.supernaut`.

* Ability to customize Micronaut framework `BeanContext` or `ApplicationContext`

== Getting Started

There is no user guide or "Getting Started" document, yet. Fortunately the framework is very simple -- currently only a handful of relatively simple classes. To get started, use either the sample Gradle or Maven project.

=== Gradle Sample Project

The https://github.com/SupernautApp/supernaut-fx-sample-gradle[Gradle sample project] currently supports running your application via Gradle and building a jlink'ed and jpackage'd application via the https://github.com/beryx/badass-jlink-plugin[Badass Gradle JLink Plugin].

To build the jpackage'd app:

. `git clone git@github.com:SupernautApp/supernaut-fx-sample-gradle.git`
. `cd supernaut-fx-sample-gradle`
. `./gradlew jpackage`
. Open the `build/jpackage` directory and launch the native application for your platform.

Or to run the app directly from Gradle:

. `./gradlew run`

=== Maven Sample Project

The https://github.com/SupernautApp/supernaut-fx-sample-maven[Maven sample project] currently supports running your application via Maven and building a natively-compiled application via https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM] and https://github.com/gluonhq/client-maven-plugin[Gluon Client Maven Plugin].

To build a GraalVM native-image:

. `git clone git@github.com:SupernautApp/supernaut-fx-sample-maven.git`
. `cd supernaut-fx-sample-maven`
. `mvn client:build`
. `mvn client:run` or open the `target/client` directory and launch the native application for your platform

Or to run the app directly from Maven:

. `mvn javafx:run`

=== Binaries

Although the API may change, binary packages are available on https://gitlab.com/SupernautApp/SupernautFX/-/packages[Gitlab.com]. You can download JARs or use the provided Maven coordinates to link to them directly from your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

==== Maven

Add the following to your `pom.xml`:

[source]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>gitlab-supernaut-maven</id>
    <url>https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/26584840/packages/maven</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----

==== Gradle

Add the following to the `repositories` section of your `build.gradle`:

[source]
----
    maven { url 'https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/26584840/packages/maven' /* gitlab-supernaut-maven */ } 
----


== Building Supernaut

. Clone the repository
. Make sure your `JAVA_HOME` points to a JDK 17 or newer
. `./gradlew buildCI buildJPackages`

To test one of the included sample apps:

. Run the sample Hello app
.. `./gradlew supernaut-fx-sample-hello:run`
. Build a `jpackage`-ed Hello app
.. `./gradlew supernaut-fx-sample-hello:jpackage`
.. Open the `supernautfx-sample-hello/build/jpackage` directory and launch the native application for your platform


== Inspired By

Supernaut.FX was inspired by two existing JavaFX DI frameworks, but is focused on JavaFX 11 and later, Java Module System, `jlink`, `jpackage`, and Micronaut framework. Thanks Adam Bien and Gluon for the inspiration.

* https://gluonhq.com/labs/ignite/[Gluon Ignite]

== Relationship to ConsensusJ

Supernaut.FX was developed for https://github.com/ConsensusJ/wallet-framework[ConsensusJ Wallet-Framework], but is general-purpose and can be used to add Micronaut framework-based DI to any JavaFX application.


== Design Goals

NOTE: If a framework or library like this already exists, please https://github.com/SupernautApp/SupernautFX/issues/3[let us know!]

We have researched https://github.com/mhrimaz/AwesomeJavaFX#frameworks[existing JavaFX frameworks] and haven't found anything that seems well-suited for the following criteria:


* Simple
** Minimizes abstraction and inheritance
** Avoids imposing architectural patterns (as much as possible with DI)
** Try to be more of a library than a framework
* Fast application launch
* Provides support for compile-time dependency injection (e.g. via https://micronaut.io[Micronaut framework])
** Initial releases are for Micronaut framework only
** Possibly in the future could use an abstraction to allow other similar DI frameworks (help wanted with this issue)
* Designed for Java apps shipped with a bundled runtime
** Applications built with JDK 17+ https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html[jpackage] (implemented)
** Applications built with https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] and https://github.com/gluonhq/substrate[Gluon Substrate] (future)
* Agressively tracks latest JDK for JavaFX, recent Android versions
** JDK 11 or later for JavaFX components
** JDK 9 (maybe JDK 8 multi-release JARs?) for base interfaces and possible Android support
* Minimal dependencies, minimal transitive dependencies
** Core components in pure Java (no additional language runtime libraries)
** Keep packaged/bundled apps as small as possible
** Minimal dependencies simplifies security review
** Potential for use by other frameworks
* Compatible with Ahead-of-Time Compile tools
** Avoids use of dynamic runtime features
** Support popular Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation platforms
*** Android
*** https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM]
* Support for first-class native-looking apps (via optional, add-on components)
** Follows each platform's UI guidelines
** First-class platform integration
** *macOS* integration
*** Support for https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/[App Sandbox]  and Mac App Store
*** Native-looking  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/menus/menu-bar-menus/[macOS Menu Bar Menus] (with help from https://github.com/0x4a616e/NSMenuFX[NSMenuFX])
*** Integration with Apple's https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging[unified logging system].
** May use additional libraries (e.g. NSMenuFX) on a specific platform
* Non-goal: reusable UI on desktop and mobile
** Android apps have option to use custom UI written with Android SDK
** iOS should have option to use UIKit
