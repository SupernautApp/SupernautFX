/**
 * <b>Supernaut.fx</b> specialization of <b>Supernaut</b> {@link ForegroundApp}. Supernaut.fx {@link FxForegroundApp}s
 * implement this interface instead of subclassing <b>OpenJFX</b> {@link Application}. This has several
 * advantages over directly extending {@link javafx.application.Application}:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *       Applications {@code implement} an {@code interface} rather than {@code extend} a {@code class}.
 *       This increases the testability and architectural flexibility of the application.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Abstracts {@link Stage} with {@link FxMainView}. This also helps with testing.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Supports faster, multi-threaded launching with {@link FxLauncherAbstract}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Supports flexible construction of application object hierarchies with {@link FxLauncherAbstract} and
 *         the {@link FxLauncherAbstract.AppFactory} interface, including Dependency Injection with <b>Micronaut</b>
 *         and possibly other DI frameworks in the future.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Summary: Implement the {@link FxForegroundApp} interface instead of subclassing OpenJFX {@link Application}. Your
 * apps will be faster and looser, but also tight. You can freely use and abuse inheritance as you please. You also
 * can get your constructor injected, which is always fun.
