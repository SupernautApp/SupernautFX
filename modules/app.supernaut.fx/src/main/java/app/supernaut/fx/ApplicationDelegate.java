 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         Supports flexible construction of application object hierarchies using Dependency Injection provided
 *         by <b>MicronautÂ®</b> framework and possibly other D.I. frameworks in the future.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *       Applications {@code implement} an {@code interface} rather than {@code extend} a {@code class}.
 *       This increases the testability and architectural flexibility of the application.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Supports faster, multi-threaded launching with the {@link FxLauncher} interface.
 *     </li>
