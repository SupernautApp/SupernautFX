 * A background application that is started before the foreground app

 * is started before the UI toolkit is initialized and can make its first
 * network requests simultaneously with loading the UI toolkit and
 * the foreground UI application.
 *
 * In the JavaFX implementation this is an alternative to the PreLoader,
 * which was essentially designed for applications that start synchronously. In
 * an asynchronous/reactive JavaFX application the primaryStage should
 * be displayed immediately and updated with data as data becomes available.
 * The important thing is that network requests be sent as soon as possible
 * after {@code main} is called.
