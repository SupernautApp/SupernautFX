/**
 * SupernautFX Hello Sample app.
 * <p>
 * This application module uses and requires Micronaut dependency injection, but module {@code app.supernaut.fx.micronaut} is
 * not needed at compile time and should <b>not</b> be listed with a {@code requires} keyword to avoid unnecessary
 * dependencies. However because we are using Micronaut annotations (e.g. {@link io.micronaut.context.annotation.Factory})
 * and classes generated by the Micronaut annotation processor, module {@link io.micronaut.inject} is
 * required. For JLink, Module {@code app.supernaut.fx.micronaut} must be configured with {@code --add-modules}
 * so that {@code jlink} will include it. See the {@code options} configuration in the {@code jlink} block in
 * this applications {@code build.gradle}.
 * <p>
 * In general, you should prefer the {@link jakarta.inject} annotations for portability reasons.
 *
 *
 * @uses app.supernaut.fx.FxLauncher You must provide the {@code app.supernaut.fx.micronaut} implementation at runtime.
