= Supernaut.FX Changes
:homepage: https://github.com/SupernautApp/SupernautFX

A high-level view of the changes in each Supernaut.FX release.

== v0.4.1-SNAPSHOT

Released: not yet

=== Dependency Upgrades

* JavaFX 18.0.1
* Micronaut 3.4.4
* SLF4J 2.0.0-alpha7

=== Build

* Upgrade to Gradle 7.4.2
* Upgrade to Spock 2.2-M1-groovy-4.0 and (transitively) Groovy 4.0.0
* Upgrade to JavaFX Plugin 0.0.13
* Upgrade to Badass JLink Plugin 2.25.0

== v0.4.0

Released: 2022-01-04

=== Improvements

* `app.supernaut` module is now JDK 8-compatible (but still has `module-info.class` in root)
* All 3 modules now have module version info

=== Dependency Upgrades

* Micronaut 3.2.4

=== Build

* Use Badass JAR Plugin to make `app.supernaut` JDK 8-compatible.
* Gradle 7.3.3
* Micronaut Test (Spock) 3.0.5
* GitLab CI build now uses  `openjdk-17-jdk`
* Travis CI build removed
* Remove vestigial (and problematic) references to Github Maven repos in `publishing` block in `maven-publish.gradle`
* Sample Apps are now version 1.4.0 and will henceforth be `1.0` plus the Supernaut.FX version.

== v0.3.1

Released: 2021-10-27

=== New functionality

* New `FxLaunder.find()` method to find the default `FxLauncher`

=== Breaking Changes

* Remove deprecated `FxForegroundApp`
* Naming changes to use "app delegate" more consistently (shouldn't affect most apps)
* Move FXML-related classes to `.fxml` sub-packages (shouldn't affect most apps)
* `MicronautFxLauncher.initializeBeanContext()` for better extensibility if you need to subclass

=== Dependency Upgrades

* JavaFX 17.0.1
* Micronaut 3.1.1
* Jakarta Inject 2.0.1 (in sample apps)

=== Build

* Gradle build file cleanup
** Use Gradle "constraint"
** Sample app dependencies are better modeled/documented


== v0.3.0

Released: 2021-10-13

=== API Improvements

* Replace `FxForegroundApp` with `ApplicationDelegate`
* `FxForegroundApp` is deprecated (it extends `ApplicationDelegate` for compatibility)
* `FxLauncher` no longer extends `Launcher`
* `ApplicationDelegate`/`FxForegroundApp` no longer extends `ForegroundApp`

=== Breaking Changes

* The deprecated `SupernautView`, `SupernautMainView`, and `FxMainView` abstraction interfaces have been removed. Just use `Stage`.
* The deprecated `OpenJfxApplicationAware` has been removed. If you need your `Application` instance override `Application#setApplication` or add an `Application` parameter to your constructor and it will be injected there.
* Upgrade to Micronaut 3.1.0 might require some tweaks to your build files. See the samples.

=== Dependency Upgrades

* Upgrade to **Micronaut 3.1.0**

== v0.2.1

Released: 2021-10-07

=== Deprecations

* The `SupernautView`, `SupernautMainView`, and `FxMainView` abstraction interfaces are deprecated (and will be removed in the next release.) Just use `Stage` directly. This abstraction added complexity without any value. I think Supernaut.FX should focus on implementing  dependency injection for JavaFX applications as simply as possible.
* `OpenJfxApplicationAware` is also deprecated. If you need an `Application` add it to your constructor and it will be injected there.

=== Module changes

* Remove `opens app.supernaut.fx.micronaut` (nothing should have been using this)

=== Breaking Changes

* Remove Gradle `api` and `module-info.java` dependency on `jakarta.inject(-api)`
* Apps using `jakarta.inject-api` _may_ need to add it to their Maven/Gradle build configuration

=== Dependency Upgrades

* Use jakarta.inject-api 2.0.1.RC1 (now with `module-info.java`) in sample/test apps

=== Build

* GitHub Actions: Use Temurin distro of JDK 17
* Use built-in Gradle module support for compiling all 3 modules (a.s.fx.micronaut was still
  using the Java Modularity plugin and the three apps continue to use it)
* Badass JLink Plugin 2.24.2
* Byte Buddy 1.11.15 (used by Spock)
* Objenesis 3.2 (used by Spock)

== v0.2.0

Released: 2021-09-16

=== Breaking Changes

* The Maven artifact filenames have changed:
** `supernaut-0.1.3.jar` -> `app.supernaut-0.2.0.jar`
** `supernaut-fx-0.1.3.jar` -> `app.supernaut.fx-0.2.0.jar`
** `supernaut-fx-micronaut-0.1.3.jar` -> `app.supernaut.fx.micronaut-0.2.0.jar`

* The upgrade to SLF4J 2.0.0-alpha5 may require changes to your build configuration. (You should be able to override the transitive dependency and force the usage of the SLF4J 1.7.x if you really need to.) Since building fully-modular apps is a major goal of this framework, we decided to upgrade to SLF4J 2.0.0 even though it is technically still "alpha".

* Classes are refactored into three JMS modules (3 JARs):

** `app.supernaut.fx.micronaut` (was package  `org.consensusj.supernautfx.micronaut`)
* Use `ServiceLoader` for `FxLauncher` so most apps won't need compile-time dependency on `app.supernaut.fx.micronaut`
* Additional class renaming and refactoring to make things more consistent
* Launch methods take application `Class` objects (which were previously passed in Launcher constructors)

=== Sample Apps

* Updated to use new modules
