Released: 2020.10.21

=== app.supernaut

* Remove `slf4j-api` dependency

=== app.supernaut.fx

* Remove dependency on JavaFX :mac JARs from POMs. (JavaFX Gradle Plugin does this unintentionally)
* Remove dependency on `javax.inject`

=== app.supernaut.fx.micronaut

* Upgrade to Micronaut 2.1.2
* Remove dependency on JavaFX :mac JARs from POMs. (JavaFX Gradle Plugin does this unintentionally)
* Change `api` dependency from `micronaut-inject-java` to `micronaut-inject` (reduces transitive dependencies)

=== Sample Apps

* Finer-grained dependencies in apps (see https://github.com/SupernautApp/SupernautFX/commit/3723c1397a34b08e9922ecc2a8321f627cf4c74f[3723c13])
* Upgrade to BadAss JLink Plugin 2.22.1

=== Build

* Don't use JavaFX Gradle Plugin

== v0.0.9

Released: 2020.10.14

=== Library

* Classes are refactored into three JMS modules (3 JARs):
** `app.supernaut` (was package `org.consensusj.supernaut`)
** `app.supernaut.fx` (was package  `org.consensusj.supernautfx`)
** `app.supernaut.fx.micronaut` (was package  `org.consensusj.supernautfx.micronaut`)
* Use `ServiceLoader` for `FxLauncher` so most apps won't need compile-time dependency on `app.supernaut.fx.micronaut`
* Additional class renaming and refactoring to make things more consistent
* Launch methods take application `Class` objects (which were previously passed in Launcher constructors)

=== Sample Apps

* Updated to use new modules

=== Dependency Upgrades

* JavaFX 15
* Micronaut 1.3.7

=== Build/Test/CI

* Gradle 6.6.1
** Use Gradle `compileJava.options.release` feature

* OpenJFX Gradle Plugin 0.0.9
* Badass JLink Plugin 2.21.1
* Groovy 3.0.6

* Gradle `:run` task not working for sample apps, see https://github.com/SupernautApp/SupernautFX/issues/6[Issue #6]


== v0.0.8

There will be no 0.0.8 release. (That version was "used up" while learning that Github Packages does not support SNAPSHOT releases.)

== v0.0.7

Released: 2020.06.28

=== Supernaut FX

* Begin separating classes into what will become three modules:
** `app.supernaut` (currently `org.consensusj.supernaut`)
** `app.supernaut.fx` (currently `org.consensusj.supernautfx`)
** `app.supernaut.fx.micronaut` (currently `org.consensusj.supernautfx.micronaut`)
* Interfaces in `org.consensusj.supernaut` create minimal abstraction layer above JavaFX
* Dual-thread startup with `ForegroundApp`/`FxForegroundApp` and `BackgroundApp`
* `AppFactory` interface to create absraction layer for DI implementations
* Upgrade to JavaFX 14.0.1
* Upgrade to Micronaut 1.3.6

  transitive dependencies on `javax.inject` and `micronaut-inject-java`
* Upgrade to Gradle 6.3

=== Sample Apps

* Build with Badass JLink Plugin 2.20.0
* Build fixes to support building with JDK 15 EA version of `jpackage`

==== Hello Sample App

* Remove explicit dependencies now that `supernautfx` module is using `java-library` correctly

==== TestApp

* Mimimal app for benchmarking with command-line options for existing at different phases of startup

=== All modules

* Significantly improved Github Actions build with downloadable installers of sample apps for JDK 14 and JDK 15 EA on macOS, Windows, and Linux

== v0.0.6

Released: 2020.03.04

* Upgrade to Micronaut 1.3.2
* Upgrade to Gradle 6.2.1
